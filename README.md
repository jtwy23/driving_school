Driving School is an e-commerce web site for new and regular pupils to view and buy driving lessons at their leisure. The site does not require a sign up if the user is only viewing lessons that they may want to purchase or even check up on the sites reviews. The user will need to sign up if they choose to buy lessons. to further entice users to sign up we are offering discounts on each lesson or if the users buy a large amount of lessons we will offer an even bigger discount. Driving School is based on 828 Driving School. It is a real business owned and operated by myself. This website is currently built on a Wordpress platform using free templates. The website is also an e-commerce site which allows users to be able to buy driving lessons online as well as get information on learning to drive and company information. I aim to implement the design and new features into the live working 828 Driving School site in the future. The website can be seen [here](https://driving-school-v1.herokuapp.com/).

### Structure Plane
The website is designed to look simple but elegant. Users will land on the page with a slider going through driving images and text to buy lessons. There is no mistaking the user has landed on a driving school website. The impactful red colored title text 'Driving School' further emphasises the type of website a user is on. As a user scrolls down the page even larger images of UK speed signs will completely reassure the user that it is a drivng school website. The other pages also share the same driving theme as well as the sticky navbar with the red colored title will always be a constant reminder to the user of where they are. Colors also match the traffic light system in the slider texts.
